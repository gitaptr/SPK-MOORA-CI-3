# Configuration files that might contain sensitive data (e.g., database credentials)

# Consider using a 'database.local.php' or similar if you need different configs.

# Session files (if using file-based sessions outside of system/cache)

/vendor/

# Web server specific files and folders

# If your .htaccess contains critical rewrite rules for deployment, you might want to track it.

# Default CI3 index.html files (often kept for security reasons in empty directories)

# You might want to remove the '!' if you truly want to ignore them.
# The `!/application/cache/index.html` already handles keeping the `index.html`
# file in specified directories.
